parse a page, and remove the image if it matches.
tested on bbc and cbc sites.
problems
1) side views are not recognized - need better face recognition
2) resulting web page is not styled. Looks like the original web page! - need to use the site's css
3) pretty slow (10 seconds or so)

But the experiment is a success
